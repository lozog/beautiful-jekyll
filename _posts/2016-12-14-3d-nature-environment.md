This is my final project for CS488. Much of the inspiration for this project comes from David Whatley's chapter in GPU Gems 2, [Toward Photorealism in Virtual Botany](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter01.html). The aim was to combine principles of procedural generation with other graphics techniques to create an immersive, organic environment. The biggest objectives of this project are procedural generation of terrain with [Perlin Noise](http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf) and procedural generation of trees with [Lindenmayer Systems](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch1.pdf).

Features include first-person camera controls, procedural terrain generation with Perlin noise, model textures, a skybox, billboards (with a screen-door effect), procedural generation of trees with L-systems, water reflections, and shadows.

Below are five screenshots of the final project. Changing input parameters allow the user to generate different scenes.
